# equality constraints
ISS orbit altitude = 423km AMSL
chaser altitude = 300km AMSL

# nonlinear constraints subject to linearization via segmentation
KOZ = 100km AMSL

# de casteljau
segment bezier curve with de casteljau algorithm

# Linearization of KOZ
for each segment of curve j, calc CG of control points, gen unit vector Nj from center of KOZ to CG, gen supporting half space with this unit vector Nj. this is KOZ linearized to inequality constraints for this segment.

# boundary condition → position, velocity, acc boundary condition as equality constraints.

p(0) = P0, p(1) = PN
v(0) = N (P1− P0), v(1) = N (PN− PN−1)
a(0) = N (N− 1)(P2− 2P1 + P0)

# derivative of curve in control point space
for control point of bezier curve P, velocity of curve is V = EDP.
and acc of curve is A = EDV = EDEDP.
where E2→3 = {1, 0, 0; 2/3, 1/3, 0; 0, 1/3, 2/3; 0, 0, 1}.

and D3→2 = 3 * {−1, 1, 0, 0; 0, −1, 1, 0; 0, 0, −1, 1}. #D(for derivative) reduces order of P by 1 and E increases order by 1
